## Readme

If you finally decided to write instructions for your repository, so new contributors don't have to spend weeks figuring out how to build and run the project, start by creating a `readme.md` file.

The extenstion `md` stands for `markdown`, [here](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) is a cheatsheet for you to get started.

Some recommendations for writing a good `readme` include:

* Write a short but representative `description` of the project.
* If the readme is gonna be long, write a `table of contents`.
* Document all necesary `installation` steps, including the `prerequisites`.
* Add `build / setup` instructions.
* Include `usage` guides and examples of your public `API` if documenting a library.
* Add information about how to `contribute`, standards, styleguides, instructions...

Note that you can have a `readme.md` in each folder of your repository and that there are multiple `tools for previewing` the output of markdown files.

## License

To specify a `License` for your project users, add a file called `LICENSE`, by default your code only belongs to you as long as you can demonstrate that you are the author.

If using GitHub you can click on `Create new file` from your repository main page and type `LICENSE` as its name, you will notice that a button appears with the label `Choose a license template`. Click on it and you will find the information related to a license accompanied by a resume.

You can use [Choose an open source license
](https://choosealicense.com/) for finding the one that best fits your needs in an easy way.
