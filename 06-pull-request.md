# Pull request

## But why?!?!

Pull request lets you inform others about changes before merging. That is very usefull since it lets you and the rest of the team discuss, review and comment them.

## Opening a pull request on GitHub

1. From GitHub page go into the branch that contains your commits.
2. Click on `new pull request`.
3. Choose the `base` branch (reciver) and the `compare` branch (the one with the changes).
4. Specify a title and write a proper description for the reviewer, then click on `create a pull request`.
5. The current changes as well as the new ones can now be seen by the reviewer.

## Reviewing a pull request on GitHub

1. Go into the `Pull requests` tab of your repository.
2. Select one for revision.
3. Select a commit to view the changes made.
4. Now you can comment each line individually and start a review.
5. Once done submit a review.
6. If the reviewer/s agree, now its time to merge the pull request by clicking on `Merge pull request`.

## Pull request without write access

To create a pull request against a repository which you don't have write access to, such as when contributing to an `Open Source` project, first you need to make a `fork`, then work on your copy as normal and finally choose the `base fork` along with the `base` and the `compare` branches when crating the pull request. Then proceed as stated before.
