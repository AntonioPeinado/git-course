## Pull request without write access

For doing a pull request agains a repository to which you don't have write access to, such as when contributing to an `Open Source` project, you first need to make a `fork`, then work on your copy as normal and finally choosing the `base fork` along with the `base` and the `compare` branches when crating a pull request, and proceed as you did before.
